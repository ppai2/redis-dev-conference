    "\n",
    "* Storing data in Redis strings\n",

    "At the end of the chapter, you should understand how to use the Redis string datatype to\n",
    "implement key-value operations and apply Redis string operations to a variety of development problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides a string datatype that is used to associate data with a particular key.\n",
    "Redis strings are the most basic datatype available in Redis and one of the first datatypes\n",
    "that users learn to work with.  Our Hello Work program in the chapter on connecting to Redis used the string datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programmers associate string datatypes with text data like the string datatype in\n",
    "most modern programming languages.  Redis strings are more like buffers that can store a wide range of data.  Redis strings can be used to store:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers\n",
    "* Floating point numbers\n",
    "* Bitmaps\n",
    "* Strings\n",
    "* Binary objects\n",
    "\n",
    "String values in Redis can be up to 512 MB in size, allowing you to store substantial binary objects including images, sound files, and object files.\n",

    "> Redis keys are also binary safe, so although most programming examples show Redis keys\n",
    "> as strings, you can use any binary sequence as a key in Redis.  Keys can also be up\n",

    "The current version of Redis (3.2) provides 24 different commands to work with the string\n",

    "In our examples, votes will be integer values, both positive and negative, associated with\n",

    "each item under the key `item:{item_no}:vote-count` and the string will be used to store\n",
    "an integer vote count. An up-vote (positive vote) is tracked as a `+1` and a down-vote\n",
    "(negative vote) is tracked as a `-1`. The votes for a particular item are the sum of all\n",
    "the up and down votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the clarity of our code, the Notebook environment includes a few utility\n",
    "functions, allowing you to focus on the Redis implementation details. In this chapter, the\n",
    "main functions that will be used from the `workshop` package are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `item_vote_key` - generates the proper key from an item id\n",
    "* `create_item_vote` - clears current vote totals from the database\n",
    "* `get_item_vote` - returns the vote total for an item \n",
    "* `users_vote_key` - returns the key for tracking a users vote\n",

    "### Working with Multiple Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The Redis GET AND SET command have variants that can operate on multiple keys at a time.\n",
    "The GET command is paired with the MGET (**M**ultiple **GET**) command that takes a\n",
    "sequence of keys and returns the value of those keys. The MSET (**M**ultiple **SET**)\n",

    "### Expiring Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys written to Redis are stored until deleted provided persistence is enabled. Without\n",
    "persistence, keys are only stored until the Redis server is shutdown or rebooted. In some\n",
    "applications, cached values are only valid for a limited time period. Redis allows you to\n",
    "optionally provide an expiration time when you set data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the SET command, Redis allows you to optionally specify the expiration time of a key\n",
    "using the EX parameter for seconds or the PX parameter for milliseconds. The *redis-py*\n",
    "library allows you to specify both of these optional parameters as keyword arguments to\n",
    "the SET function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides two other (redundant) functions for setting keys with an expiration time.\n",
    "The PSETEX can be used to set a key with a millisecond expiration time and the SETEX\n",
    "command that allows you to set the expiration in seconds. Since these functions are\n",
    "redundant to the SET command options, it is possible they may be deprecated and removed in\n",
    "future versions of Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test and Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides a third variant of the SET operation to perform \"test-and-set\" operations.\n",
    "The Redis SETNX (**SET** **N**ot e**X**ists) command allows you to provisionally set the\n",
    "value of a key, provided that the key is not already defined. Redis returns a result of\n",
    "`1` if the key was set and `0` if the key was not set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SET command provides optional `NX` and `XX` flags that update the key only when it\n",

    "In our first Hello World program, we introduced the GET and SET operations using the\n",
    "familiar key-value paradigm, the string datatype provides additional functionality and\n",
    "flexibility beyond the basic GET and SET operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we used the string data type to store vote counts for blog posts on an\n",
    "website. We saw how strings could be treated as integers, allowing us to update vote\n",
    "counts directly in Redis using increment and decrement commands. We also saw how strings\n",
    "could be treated as bitmaps to provide compact representations of boolean information.\n",
    "Finally, we learned about several of the variants of GET and SET which support multiple\n",
    "keys, manage time-to-live values, and perform test-and-set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis strings are not like the strings we think of from programming languages. Redis\n",
    "strings can be used to store many different kinds of data, data we don't normally think of\n",
    "as string data. We've seen how the GET and SET operations are used to implement a basic\n",
    "key-value store and we've also seen how other operations can be used to manipulate strings\n",
